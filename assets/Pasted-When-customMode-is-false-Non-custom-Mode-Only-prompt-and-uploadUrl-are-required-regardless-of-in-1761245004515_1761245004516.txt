When customMode is false (Non-custom Mode):
Only prompt and uploadUrl are required regardless of instrumental setting
prompt length limit: 500 characters
Other parameters should be left empty
​
Developer Notes
Recommended settings for new users: Set customMode to false, instrumental to false, and only provide prompt and uploadUrl. This is the simplest configuration to quickly test the API and experience the results.
Generated files will be deleted after 15 days
Ensure all required parameters are provided based on customMode and instrumental settings to avoid errors
Pay attention to character limits for prompt, style, and title to ensure successful processing
Callback process has three stages: text (text generation complete), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks
The uploadUrl parameter is used to specify the upload location of the audio file; please provide a valid URL.
​
Optional parameters
vocalGender (string): Vocal gender preference. Use m for male, f for female.
styleWeight (number): Strength of adherence to style. Range 0–1, up to 2 decimals. Example: 0.65.
weirdnessConstraint (number): Controls creative deviation. Range 0–1, up to 2 decimals. Example: 0.65.
audioWeight (number): Balance weight for audio features. Range 0–1, up to 2 decimals. Example: 0.65.

​
prompt
stringrequired
A description of the desired audio content.

In Custom Mode (customMode: true): Required if instrumental is false. The prompt will be strictly used as the lyrics and sung in the generated track. Character limits by model:

"A calm and relaxing piano track with soft melodies"

​
customMode
booleanrequired
Enables Custom Mode for advanced audio generation settings.

Set to true to use Custom Mode (requires style and title; prompt required if instrumental is false). The prompt will be strictly used as lyrics if instrumental is false.
Set to false for Non-custom Mode (only prompt is required). Lyrics will be auto-generated based on the prompt.

​
model
enum<string>required
The AI model version to use for generation.

Required for all requests.
Available options:
V5: Superior musical expression, faster generation.
V4_5PLUS: V4.5+ is richer sound, new waysto create, max 8 min.
V4_5: V4.5 is smarter prompts, fastergenerations, max 8 min.
V4: V4 is improved vocal quality,max 4 min.
V3_5: V3.5 is better song structure,max 4 min.

string<uri>required
The URL to receive audio covering task completion updates. Required for all audio covering requests.

System will POST task status and results to this URL when audio covering completes
Callback includes generated covered audio files with new style while preserving original melody
Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with JSON payload containing covered track results and audio URLs
For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see Audio Covering Callbacks
Alternatively, use the Get Music Details endpoint to poll task status
Example:
"https://api.example.com/callback"
